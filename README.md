## Dataset
### Pizza_sales.csv 
This dataset serves as the primary source for analyzing pizza sales.  
### Key Columns  
The dataset includes the following important columns:  
- **pizzaID**: Primary key representing each type of pizza.  
- **orderID**: Unique identifier for each order.  
- **quantity**: Number of pizzas purchased in the order.  
- **price**: Price of the pizza per unit.  
- **pizza size**: Size of the pizza (e.g., M, L, XL).  
- **order date**: Date when the order was placed.

## Tools and Techniques  

In this Pizza Sales Analysis project, the following tools and techniques were utilized:  

- **SQL**:   
  - Used for querying the pizza sales database to extract relevant data, perform aggregations, and generate insights based on sales trends. [Download here](https://microsoft.com)
  
- **Power BI**:  
  - Utilized for data visualization and reporting. Power BI was instrumental in creating interactive dashboards and visual representations of the sales data, enabling easier analysis and decision-making. [Download here](https://microsoft.com)

## Data Extraction/ Cleaning/ Modelling  
In the Pizza Sales Analysis project, the following steps were followed for data extraction and cleaning:  
1. **Extraction using SSMS**:  
   - Used SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to extract the dataset into a CSV file.
2. **Data Type Adjustments**:  
   - Encountered issues with the data type of one particular column that prevented successful extraction.

   - Changed the data type of the problematic column to a string to facilitate successful import.

3. **Creating a New Column**:  
   - Created a new column to temporarily hold the values from the old column.  
4. **Data Transfer**:  
   - Transferred all data from the old column to the newly created column.  
5. **Dropping the Old Column**:  
   - Removed the old column from the dataset since it was no longer needed.  
6. **Final Data Type Conversion**:  
   - Converted the data type of the new column to a date format.  
   - Renamed the new column to match the original name of the old column.

This process ensured that the data was properly structured and clean for further analysis in Power BI.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
The Exploratory Data Analysis involved using SQL to explore the pizza sales dataset to answer key questions, including:  
1. **Total Revenue**  
2. **Average Order Value**  
3. **Total Pizzas Sold**  
4. **Total Orders**  
5. **Average Pizza Per Order**  
6. **Daily Trend of Total Orders**  
7. **Monthly Trend of Total Orders**  
8. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category**  
9. **Top 5 Pizzas by Revenue by order, quantity and revenue**
10. **Bottom 5 Pizzas by order, quantity and revenue**

These analyses provided valuable insights into sales performance and customer purchasing behavior.

## Visualization  
In this project, several visualizations were created to effectively communicate the insights from the pizza sales data:  
- **Bar Chart**: Displays the top 5 and bottom 5 pizzas based on order quantity and revenue.  
- **Line Graph**: Illustrates the monthly trend of total orders.  
- **Stacked Column Chart**: Depicts the daily trend of total orders.  
- **Doughnut Chart**: Represents the percentage of sales by pizza category and size.

- **Geographical Limitations**: The findings may not be applicable to other locations or markets outside the dataset.    
- **Market Behavior Changes**: Shifts in consumer preferences over the years, influenced by trends, may not be fully reflected in the analysis.

## Recommendations  
1. **Promote Top Sellers**:  
   - Focus marketing efforts on high-performing pizzas, such as Classic Deluxe and Pepperoni. Offer special deals to boost sales.  
2. **Revise Underperformers**:  
   - Analyze and adjust recipes for low-selling pizzas, and consider promotions to increase awareness and sales.  
3. **Seasonal Promotions**:  
   - Introduce limited-time offerings during holidays or peak seasons, and monitor their performance for future adjustments.  
4. **Diversify Menu Options**:  
   - Expand the menu to include vegetarian, gluten-free, and vegan pizzas in response to consumer trends.  
5. **Focus on High-Revenue Items**:  
   - Highlight and promote high-revenue pizzas like Thai Chicken in advertising to maximize sales.  
6. **Cross-Sell Opportunities**:  
   - Implement strategies to suggest complementary sides and drinks during customer orders to increase average transaction value.  
7. **Data-Driven Insights**:  
   - Continuously analyze sales data to quickly adapt strategies based on customer behavior and market trends.  
By adopting these strategies, the company can enhance its offerings, improve customer satisfaction, and drive growth.
